## Typical setup guidelines for FA-07 type machines
Once all apparatuses are in position, we suggest creating a table that 
links each piste number to the corresponding FA-07â€™s IP address, which can 
be modified via programming step P.04 (chapter 5.2); we suggest using an IP 
address between 192.168.000.020 and 192.168.000.254, i.e., leaving the first 9 digits the same (192.168.000) unless they are already being used by other devices. Make sure that the IP addresses of the various apparatuses connected via LAN are all different from one another.

Leave the port number of all FA-07s, shown in programming step P.05, at 50100 and modify it only in accordance with the central management system.
